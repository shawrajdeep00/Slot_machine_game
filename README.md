# Slot Machine Game

This is a simple slot machine game implemented in Python. The game allows players to deposit money, bet on multiple lines, and spin the slot machine to win prizes based on matching symbols across lines.

## Features

- **Deposit System:** Players can deposit money to start playing.
- **Betting Options:** Bet on multiple lines (1-3) with customizable bet amounts.
- **Random Slot Machine Spins:** Each spin generates random symbols (A, B, C, D) for each line.
- **Winning Mechanism:** Players win prizes based on matching symbols across lines.
- **Game Quit Option:** Quit the game at any time.

## Concepts Used

The code utilizes several Python concepts and features:

1. **Functions:** Modularized code using functions for specific tasks such as checking winnings, generating slot machine spins, depositing money, etc.
2. **Dictionaries:** Storing symbol counts and values using Python dictionaries (`symbol_count` and `symbol_value`).
3. **Lists and Loops:** Iterating through lists and using loops for generating slot machine spins, checking winnings, and other operations.
4. **Random Module:** Utilizing the `random` module to generate random symbols for each slot machine spin.
5. **Input Validation:** Validating user inputs for deposit amount, number of lines, and bet amount to ensure correct inputs are provided.
6. **String Formatting:** Using string formatting (`f""`) to display messages with dynamic content such as current balance, bet amounts, and winnings. Available to python 3.6 and above

## Usage

To play the game:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the game by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   python slot_machine.py
